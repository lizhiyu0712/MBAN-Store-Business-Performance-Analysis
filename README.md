The project involves students collaborating in groups to generate a Tableau report that incorporates interactive dashboards and narratives. The main aim is to comprehend the factors influencing the financial performance of MBAN Store and propose strategies for enhancing sales and profitability. The groups will then present their analysis, findings, and suggestions to the executive management team of MBAN Store, which includes the CEO acting as the instructor, the CFO as a guest lecturer, and the entire class. Throughout this project, the MBAN Store dataset will be utilized.

There are two primary objectives for this project. The initial objective is to employ Tableau for data analysis, constructing advanced visualizations, and developing dashboards and stories that facilitate actionable insights. The utilization of data visualization techniques covered in class will be emphasized. The second objective is to design and deliver an impactful presentation that effectively communicates the derived insights and recommendations to the executive audience.
